Artemis Financial was a investment company looking to implement a few measures of security for their web applicaiton.
They wanted a qualified person to address any security vulnerabilites in their applicaiton and to rectify them. 
The most challenging aspect of the security implementations was understanding the SHA algorithms and implementing the check sum. 
The code I implemented would suffice for implementing software secuirty standards.
